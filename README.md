# Drone Simulation Interface
## Overview:
 The Drone Simulation Interface is a Java application developed as part of the "OOP Programming with Java" university project. This application is designed to interact with a drone simulation system through a web-based RESTful API. The system actively generates detailed reports on a fleet of simulated drones, providing real-time information on various parameters such as drone states, trajectories, battery levels, 
cargo details, and more.

- Drone: Here, you'll find unique information related to each drone, identified by serial numbers or specific cargo weights. It gives a detailed insight into the characteristics of individual drones within the fleet.

- Drone Type: This section encompasses static data shared among all drones of a particular model. Examples include maximum speed, manufacturing details, and other model-specific information.

- Drone Dynamics: This segment provides temporal dynamic data for each drone, capturing real-time specifics like velocity, location, and battery life. It offers a comprehensive view of the drones' current state and movement.


Important Note: Please be aware that the API supporting this application is hosted on the university server and is accessible only within the university network or via VPN.

####   System Requirements: Java Version 17

Additionally, there's a possibility that the API may be deleted in the future.
